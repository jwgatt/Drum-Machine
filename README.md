# drum-machine

Drum machine because everybody loves it when the kid nextdoor gets a drum kit for christmas. I thought this would be a fun project to keep my modern react skills sharp. The App is refractored to react hooks from a project that was using classes.

## future-features
- Playback speed slider
- On/Off button
- Add my own sounds
- Switch to change to soundBank2
